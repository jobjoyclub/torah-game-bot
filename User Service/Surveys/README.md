# User Surveys

This folder tracks outreach and feedback from Tora users.

Structure:

```
User Surveys/
├── README.md          # This guide
├── summary.md         # Aggregated insights and next actions
└── responses/         # One file per user response
```

Guidelines:
- Add each contacted user to `summary.md` with status: contacted / replied / no response.
- For each reply, create a file in `responses/` named `YYYY-MM-DD_username.md`.
- Keep personally sensitive data minimal; focus on feedback and use cases.
