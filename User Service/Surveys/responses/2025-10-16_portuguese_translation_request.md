# Survey Response - Portuguese Translation Request

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Language:** English (requesting Portuguese/Brazilian Portuguese)  
**Status:** Replied  

## Feedback

My first suggestion is to expand the system with a translation system for Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese.
I don't know if it's already available in Spanish. It's the most widely spoken language in Latin America.
The more people have access, the better.

Another thing: Train the AI ​​with a good database.
An excellent resource in Portuguese is Veshinantam.
It has the basis for studying the Chitat (Chumash, Tehillim, Tanya) among many other important daily studies.
Molad, Tefilat Ha'Derech, Gemara, Maamar, Dvar Torah, Geulah, and Machiach, Halachot.

I can provide PDFs of the studies that complete the entire year.
I think this would be a great base.
